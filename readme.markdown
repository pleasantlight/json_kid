json_kid
========

This is a simple engine for parsing and generating JSON strings for Objective-C/iOS applications.
I created this engine - instead of using one of the plethora of engines out there, or the new Json support embedded into iOS 5 SDK - since I needed something that was backward compatible with iOS 3.x platforms, but still supported the new ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) features supported by Xcode 4.2.

I have no claims about performance - it probably sucks, especially the JSON generator.

Anyway, I hope you find it useful until iOS < 4.x becomes extinct.

Go Mavs!

Enjoy,
